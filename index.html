	<p class="text">This site is designed to empower you to go out and start riding. We seek to add to the number of people riding and entering the hobby. This should make the process less stressful and more approachable.</p>

<p> Mission Statement:<br>
After two years and thousands of customer interactions, I was inspired to create content that explained the buying process that is involved with Powersports. My purpose is to educate buyers and improve their shopping experience. This site will serve as a guide through the buying process, with insider knowledge of a dealership. You will come away with information that will empower you to make an informed decision when you buy your next Motorcycle, ATV, or Side by Side. <p/>

<p>Where to Start:<br>
Thanks to sites like YouTube, there is an abundance of information available targeting new and returning riders. This is a great place to start your journey. There are so many creators with detailed videos talking about and preforming ride a longs on most bikes on the market. Exploring this can lend insight into the kind of motorcycle that might appeal to you. Doing your homework is the smartest decision you can make when beginning the process of buying a motorcycle. <p/>
